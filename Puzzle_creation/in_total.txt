only "in total", in binary (http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/convert-text-to-binary/):
01101001 01101110 00100000 01110100 01101111 01110100 01100001 01101100 

Just the counts, they always start with zero:
121121 12131 215 13112 1214 13112 1241 12122

In total, in this encoding, would be 
121121   12131   215  13112   1214  13112   1241   12122   
in groups:
12-11-21 12-13-1 21-5 13-11-2 12-14 13-1-12 1-24-1 12-1-22 
letters at those positions:
lku       lma     ue   mkb     ln    mal    axa     lav


MUCH OF THE ENCRYPTION BELOW is done in Crypto.ipynb in ~/nerd/puzzles

Add the sentence "to find out how many layers there will be" to the start, and viginere with key "pincers" to find, without spaces:

tofindouthowmanylayerstherewillbelkulmauemkblnmalaxalav

becomes:
iwskrugjbuqadscgyccvjhbugvvoxtydiccjtzcyvezjypqrdpfnnem


Putting back the spaces:

to find out how many layers there will be lku lma ue mkb ln mal axa lav
iw skru gjb uqa dscg yccvjh bugvv oxty di ccj tzc yv ezj yp qrd pfn nem


Then, add "you will need to use pincers" to the start of that:

you will need to use pincers iw skru gjb uqa dscg yccvjh bugvv oxty di ccj tzc yv ezj yp qrd pfn nem

And encrypt that whole thing with an alternativel +4, -5, +3 rotation (a la Caesar) to find  (4, 5, 3 are word lengths of the first bit)
cjx rlpg rzhh ws xwz tdqgzuw la vomx bmf xuv hnfk bgxync fpjzq sswc gm fge xuf ty zcn bt tvy taq ihq


And the fisrt step will eb a very simple, 1 shift Caesar, to make sure people get the gist, after adding "Good start, but" to the start.

good start, but cjx rlpg rzhh ws xwz tdqgzuw la vomx bmf xuv hnfk bgxync fpjzq sswc gm fge xuf ty zcn bt tvy taq ihq

becomes
hppe tubsu, cvu dky smqh saii xt yxa uerhavx mb wpny cng yvw iogl chyzod gqkar ttxd hn ghf yvg uz ado cu uwz ubr jir

Adding back the upper case start and a exclamation at the end:
Hppe tubsu, cvu dky smqh saii xt yxa uerhavx mb wpny cng yvw iogl chyzod gqkar ttxd hn ghf yvg uz ado cu uwz ubr jir!


to have a puzzle solving to 
Good start, but you will need to use pincers to find out how many layers there will be in total!
With answer 4.
